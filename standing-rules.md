## Standing

1. A member has the floor when recognized by the Speaker, and does not have to stand up.

## In-Camera Session

1. The motion to enter an *in camera* session (or to “move *in camera*”) is a privileged motion that:
   1. takes precedence of all others except the privileged motions to take a recess, to adjourn, and to fix the time to which to adjourn, to which it yields;
   1. requires a majority vote;
   1. is in order only when not already *in camera*;
   1. is amendable only as to the additional persons permitted to remain during the *in camera* session;
   1. may be renewed as frequently as the motion to adjourn;
   1. requires no second;
   1. is debatable only as to the anticipated need for secrecy;
   1. cannot be reconsidered; and
   1. is out of order when another has the floor.
1. The motion to leave an *in camera* session (or to “move *ex camera*”) is a privileged motion that:
   1. takes precedence of all others except the motion to enter an *in camera* session and those to which that motion yields, to which it yields;
   1. requires a majority vote;
   1. is in order only when made *in camera*;
   1. is not amendable;
   1. may be renewed as frequently as the motion to adjourn;
   1. requires no second;
   1. is debatable only as to the continued need (or lack thereof) for secrecy;
   1. cannot be reconsidered; and
   1. is out of order when another has the floor.
1. The members of the assembly who are permitted to vote on the secret business to be discussed *in camera*, and the chair and secretary of the meeting, are always permitted to remain in an *in camera* session.
   1. If it is desired to exclude a voting member of the assembly, they must first be barred from voting on the secret business.
   1. If it is desired to exclude the chair or secretary, an interim chair or secretary must first be elected.
1. If the motion to enter an *in camera* session is adopted:
   1. when another question is before the assembly, the *in camera* session automatically ends when the pending main motion is disposed of, if not already ended;
   1. otherwise, the *in camera* session ends only by motion.
1. When a motion to enter an *in camera* session is adopted:
   1. All persons not permitted to remain must leave the room.
   1. The chair shall then prompt for a motion to leave the *in camera* session, in case the reasons for moving *in camera* were, themselves, secret.
1. When a motion to leave an *in camera* session is adopted:
   1. The *in camera* session ends immediately.
   1. Any persons previously required to leave should be invited to return.
1. Minutes are still kept during *in camera* sessions, but they shall not normally be published, and members permitted to remain are obliged to not divulge discussions made *in camera*.
   1. Notwithstanding the above, a motion disposed of *in camera* must have its text and disposition published, unless its text was never publicized *ex camera* and implementing its effects does not require disclosing its disposition.
1. These standing rules on *in camera* sessions replace the provisions of Robert’s Rules relating to executive sessions.
1. While the correct Latin pronunciation of *camera* is /ˈkamera/, in the Engineering Society the word is pronounced [kʰ(ə)ˈmɛɹə], for historical reasons.

## Speaking Limits

1. Members are permitted to speak any number of times and for any duration to a single motion, unless, by motion, the assembly adopts limits on debate.

## Submission of Documents

1. All documents, reports, and appendices shall be submitted at least seventy-two (72) hours prior to the commencement of each regular meeting of the Board of Directors, unless otherwise specified in the Bylaws or barring extraneous circumstances at the discretion of the Speaker.

## Reports and Discussion Items

1. Members may submit discussion items for inclusion on the agenda. These are treated the same as regular motions, with the following exceptions:
   1. The Speaker need not read out the text of a discussion item, only announce that it has commenced.
   1. No text may be submitted with a discussion item other than the topic of discussion (no WHEREAS clauses or resolutions).
   1. No seconder is required (but a member may move to object to the consideration of the item as usual).
   1. No voting is done and no action results from the conclusion of the discussion (but members may make main motions as a result of the discussion, as usual).
   1. There being no resulting action, it is out of order to amend a discussion item.
   1. There being no voting, it is out of order to reconsider or indefinitely postpone a discussion item.
1. Reports are a special form of discussion item with precedence on the agenda. They may only be submitted when demanded by Bylaws, Policies, or motion of the Board or a General Meeting. The proper form of a report is "REPORT by (reporter)" or "REPORT by (reporter) on (topic)".
1. The proper form of all other discussion items is "DISCUSSION by (submitter) on (topic)".

## Consent Agenda

1. The Speaker shall submit to each meeting of the Board a motion "to adopt the consent agenda" (a.k.a. a "motion to consent" to the consent agenda), which shall be the last motion on the agenda except for discussion items and adjournnment. All motions on the agenda that follow the motion to consent, except discussion items and the final motion to adjourn, are part of the "consent agenda", unless the motion specifies otherwise.
1. If any voting member of the Board objects to the motion to consent, it fails and the consent agenda will be considered sequentially in the usual manner. Otherwise, i.e. if the motion to consent is adopted unanimously, all of the motions on the consent agenda are simultaneously adopted unanimously.
1. At any point before the motion to consent is disposed of, any EngSoc Member may cause an item on the consent agenda to be removed therefrom, by requesting that the Speaker do so.
   1. If the request is made before the motion to consent is taken up, the item shall be placed just before the motion to consent.
   1. If the request is made after the motion to consent is taken up, the item shall be placed just after the last item that remains on the consent agenda, and shall be taken up after the motion to consent is disposed of.
   1. Other than such requests, the motion to consent is undebatable and unamendable.
1. Only an affirmative vote on the motion to consent may be reconsidered, and it cannot have any subsidiary motions applied to it. Since a single objection defeats the motion, no seconder is required.
