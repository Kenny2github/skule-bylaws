## Standing

1. A member has the floor when recognized by the Speaker, and does not have to stand up.

## In-Camera Session

1. The motion to enter an *in camera* session (or to “move *in camera*”) is a privileged motion that:
   1. takes precedence of all others except the privileged motions to take a recess, to adjourn, and to fix the time to which to adjourn, to which it yields;
   1. requires a majority vote;
   1. is in order only when not already *in camera*;
   1. is amendable only as to the additional persons permitted to remain during the *in camera* session;
   1. may be renewed as frequently as the motion to adjourn;
   1. requires no second;
   1. is debatable only as to the anticipated need for secrecy;
   1. cannot be reconsidered; and
   1. is out of order when another has the floor.
1. The motion to leave an *in camera* session (or to “move *ex camera*”) is a privileged motion that:
   1. takes precedence of all others except the motion to enter an *in camera* session and those to which that motion yields, to which it yields;
   1. requires a majority vote;
   1. is in order only when made *in camera*;
   1. is not amendable;
   1. may be renewed as frequently as the motion to adjourn;
   1. requires no second;
   1. is debatable only as to the continued need (or lack thereof) for secrecy;
   1. cannot be reconsidered; and
   1. is out of order when another has the floor.
1. The members of the assembly who are permitted to vote on the secret business to be discussed *in camera*, and the chair and secretary of the meeting, are always permitted to remain in an *in camera* session.
   1. If it is desired to exclude a voting member of the assembly, they must first be barred from voting on the secret business.
   1. If it is desired to exclude the chair or secretary, an interim chair or secretary must first be elected.
1. If the motion to enter an *in camera* session is adopted:
   1. when another question is before the assembly, the *in camera* session automatically ends when the pending main motion is disposed of, if not already ended;
   1. otherwise, the *in camera* session ends only by motion.
1. When a motion to enter an *in camera* session is adopted:
   1. All persons not permitted to remain must leave the room.
   1. The chair shall then prompt for a motion to leave the *in camera* session, in case the reasons for moving *in camera* were, themselves, secret.
1. When a motion to leave an *in camera* session is adopted:
   1. The *in camera* session ends immediately.
   1. Any persons previously required to leave should be invited to return.
1. Minutes are still kept during *in camera* sessions, but they shall not normally be published, and members permitted to remain are obliged to not divulge discussions made *in camera*.
   1. Notwithstanding the above, a motion disposed of *in camera* must have its text and disposition published, unless its text was never publicized *ex camera* and implementing its effects does not require disclosing its disposition.
1. These standing rules on *in camera* sessions replace the provisions of Robert’s Rules relating to executive sessions.
1. While the correct Latin pronunciation of *camera* is /ˈkamera/, in the Engineering Society the word is pronounced [kʰ(ə)ˈmɛɹə], for historical reasons.

## Speaking Limits

1. Members are permitted to speak any number of times and for any duration to a single motion, unless, by motion, the assembly adopts limits on debate.

## Submission of Documents

1. All documents, reports, and appendices shall be submitted at least seventy-two (72) hours prior to the commencement of each regular meeting of the Board of Directors, unless otherwise specified in the Bylaws or barring extraneous circumstances at the discretion of the Speaker.
