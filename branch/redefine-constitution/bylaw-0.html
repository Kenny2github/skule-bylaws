					A bylaw amendment made by the Board of Directors is effective only until the next Annual General Meeting or a General Meeting called for the purpose of its ratification unless confirmed thereat, and in default of confirmation thereat, ceases to have effect at and from that time, and in that case no new bylaw of the same or like substance has any effect until confirmed at a General Meeting. If such approval has not occurred by the next Annual General Meeting the amendment is struck down and neither it nor any substantially similar amendment may be proposed at a meeting of the Board for one year following the date of the Annual General Meeting.
